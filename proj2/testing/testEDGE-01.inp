# Makes sure that if AI / manual cannot make a move from start end in draw.
# Checks that AI won't make an illegal move and that user is not prompted 
# for a move since both colors cannot make a move in this case. Similar edge
# cases when neither side can move will behave accordingly as well. Finally,
# tests that draw works, since red win / blue win are already tested elsewhere.
